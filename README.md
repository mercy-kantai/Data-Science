## Data-Science

This repository contains three files tuples,stacks and queues.

# Tuples

Tuple is an ordered list of values that store multiple data types.
Some advantages of a tuple are safety, and efficiency. Disadvantage of tuples is less convinient.
Immutability is a both advantage and disadvantage of a tuple since it is immutable meaning it cannot be chaged.
Tuples are use to insert records to a data base and it is used as a parenthesis checker

# Stacks

A data stack is a collection of various technologies that allow raw data to be proccesed before it can be used.
Some advantages of stacks are, fast to access and efficient meemory utilization. Disdavantages are limited capacity
and no randon access. Stacks are stored in a LIFO FILO format meaning last item pushed inside a stack is the first popped out.


# Queues 

A queue is a linear data structure that has follows three principles, FIFO, LIFO and priority.
Advanatges of queues is that it maintains order , it is also used to implement other data structure such as stacks.
Disadvantges are that queue has no random access and also it has limited capacity.
